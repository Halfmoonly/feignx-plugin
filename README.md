FeignX is inspired by IDEA's star plugin MybatisX. 

The FeignX plugin monitors all FeignClient and ApiController in the project based on real-time scanning mechanism, and provides method-level navigation jump capability. 

In short, You can flexibly jump back and forth between FeignClient and remote service ApiController through method-level navigation buttons.
